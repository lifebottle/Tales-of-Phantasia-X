"Dhaos could not be harmed

"Dhaos, wounded during the final

between two worlds that's allowing 
it to escape into this area."

"Humans can tolerate it to a

can't."

"The Secret of Elven Longevity"
Compared to the race of Man,
Our superior healthcare and
especially nutritious diet play a
part in this, but... 
...evolution is also involved.
Small differences appear in 
living creatures from generation 
to generation.
Through the process of 
evolution,
small random changes...
eventually lead to a major
difference.
If this theory is correct, then
Elves are less evolved, because
each generation is so long.
Put in other words, our race are 
superior enough that there is 
no need to evolve anymore.

Spirit so she called the Soldier
up into the heavens."

Today's top news is political.
At 2:00 PM today, the Kingdom

Republic of Odin near the border.
This ends a three-day truce 
between King Ralph I of Fenrir and
President Mitsumori of Odin.
President Galga of Thor had this 
to say about the situation.
"I definitely want this conflict 
settled through negotiation,
rather than through bloodshed."
"However, I have not written off 
the use of a bombing campaign as 
a last resort."
President Galga's indication of
military intervention is sure to
lead to further controversy.
Also in the news today...
According to the Thor Research 
Lab, Comet Samier is expected to 
barely miss the planet.
We have received footage of the
press conference.
"It was first thought that the comet
might hit the city of Thor, but
this proved to be a false alarm."
"According to the calculations of

"Although the comet's tail will
graze the planet, there is no
danger of a direct hit."

This is a side-scrolling shooting
game. Use the direction pad or

Use the _(526) button to shoot
forwards, and the _(525) button to
shoot behind.
You can also shoot up and down 
with _(527).
When the gauge in the upper right
is green, use _(524) for temporary
invincibility.

Unk0: 1935b, Lenght: 174
Enemies appear from the back of

Shoot them down when they 
appear in front of you.
You are only hit if the enemies hit
your broom. They cannot hit your
head.

Unk0: 1935c, Lenght: 121
You gain more points per enemy 
as time progresses.

number of points you gain
decreases.

When vertical shots reach the top
level, they become a 'Spark Wave'.
"The black spheres of the Spark 
Wave will erase normal shots and

This is useful when there are
obstacles above and below.

Unk0: 1935e, Lenght: 216
You can use your special shot 
when the upper right gauge is 
glowing green.
It has limited shots, so save it
for critical moments.
If you leave the gauge at full, it
will become red and you'll gain
bonus points.

Unk0: 1935f, Lenght: 156
As for power-ups, there are three
weapons with three stages.
At the top level over 100,000
points, if you take damage you will
return to the first level.

Unk0: 19360, Lenght: 145
If you take no damage at all,
you'll get a No Miss Bonus.
You can get a No Damage Bonus

"The History of the Kingdom of
Euclid"
The history of the Kingdom of
Euclid goes back approximately 
120 years.
The Republic of Euclid, which was
the Kingdom's predecessor, was 
made up of three different clans.
One was the Deloino Clan, which
ruled the Venezian continent.
The Maelgan Clan ruled the 
southern part of the Euclidian 
continent.
(Some think that this clan 
created the Catacombs, which 
were destroyed 50 years ago.)
Finally, the Euclidian Clan held
sway over the northern part of

One theory stated that they
